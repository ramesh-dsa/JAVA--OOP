Access Modifiers in Java
Last Updated : 8 May, 2026
Access modifiers in Java are used to control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. They help enforce encapsulation by restricting access to different parts of a program. Java provides four types of access modifiers to define scope and protection levels.

Public modifier: It is accessible from anywhere in the program
Protected modifier: It is accessible within the same package and by subclasses
Private modifier: It is accessible only within the same class
Default modifier: It is accessible only within the same package
Real-World Example :In a banking app, private is used for balance (hidden), default for internal helpers, protected for methods used in subclasses, and public for actions like deposit or view details.

Types of Access Modifiers
There are 4 types of access modifiers available in Java: 

Access-Modifiers-in-Java-1
Access Modifiers in Java
Private Access Modifier
The private access modifier is specified using the keyword private. The methods or data members declared as private are accessible only within the class in which they are declared.




class Person {
​
    // private variable
    private String name;
​
    public void setName(String name)  {
​
        this.name = name; // accessible within class
    }
​
    public String getName() { return name; }
}
​
public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
​
        Person p = new Person();
        p.setName("Alice");
​
        // System.out.println(p.name); // Error: 'name'
        // has private access
        System.out.println(p.getName());
    }
}

Output
Alice
Explanation: Direct access to name is not allowed outside Person, enforcing encapsulation.

Default Access Modifier
If no access modifier is specified, the member has default (package-private) access and can only be accessed within the same package.This means only classes within the same package can access it.




// accessible within the same package
class Car {
    String model; // default access
}
​
public class Main {
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        Car c = new Car();
        c.model = "Tesla"; // accessible within the same package
        System.out.println(c.model);
    }
}

Output
Tesla
Explanation: Members with default access cannot be accessed from classes in a different package.

Geeks.java: Default class within the same package


// default access modifier 
package p1; 

// Class Geek is having 
// Default access modifier 
class Geek 
{ 
    void display() 
    { 
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); 
    } 
}
GeeksNew.java: Default class from a different package (for contrast)


// package with default modifier 
package p2; 
import p1.*;    // importing package p1

// This class is having 
// default access modifier 
class GeekNew { 
    public static void main(String args[]) { 
      
        // Accessing class Geek from package p1 
        Geek o = new Geek(); 

        o.display(); 
    } 
}
Explanation: In this example, the program will show the compile-time error when we try to access a default modifier class from a different package.

Protected Access Modifier
The protected access modifier is specified using the keyword protected. The methods or data members declared as protected are accessible within the same package or subclasses in different packages.


// File: Vehicle.java in package p1
package p1;
public class Vehicle {
    protected int speed;
}

// File: Bike.java in package p2
package p2;
import p1.Vehicle;
public class Bike extends Vehicle {
    void showSpeed() {
        speed = 100; // allowed: subclass in different package
        System.out.println(speed);
    }
}

// File: Test.java in package p2
package p2;
import p1.Vehicle;
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bike b = new Bike();
        b.showSpeed(); // prints 100

        Vehicle v = new Vehicle();
        // System.out.println(v.speed); // ERROR: cannot access protected outside package & non-subclass
    }
}

Output
Access via subclass method: 100
0
Explanation: speed is accessible via subclass methods and other classes in the same package, but direct access from a different package (non-subclass) would fail.

Public Access Modifier
The public access modifier is specified using the keyword ! public. Public members are accessible from everywhere in the program. There is no restriction on the scope of public data members.




class MathUtils { 
    
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
​
public class Main {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        System.out.println(MathUtils.add(5, 10)); // accessible anywhere
    }
}

Output
15
Explanation: add() is globally accessible due to the public modifier.

Top-level classes or interfaces can not be declared as private because, private means "only visible within the enclosing class".

Access-Modifier
When to Use Access Modifier in Real-World Projects
Private: The idea should be use as restrictive access as possible, so private should be used as much as possible.
Default (Package-Private): Often used in package-scoped utilities or helper classes.
Protected: Commonly used in inheritance-based designs like framework extensions.
! Public: This is used for API endpoints, service classes, or utility methods shared across different parts of an application.
